# OpenWest 2014 Electronics Project Kit
We will be releasing the demo code / schematics / etc into the wild sometime on Thursday.

Please keep an eye out here.

Please see us in SB276 for help soldering your kit, or to answer any questions you may have.

P.S. Don't forget to stop by with a laptop and check out our Open CTF games. :)
